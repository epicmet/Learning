# Books

Here you can find my attempts to get the most out of a book. I would simply explain what I got after reading a chapter or two to some imaginary audience, they are not some summeries of the chapters though, they exists because I wanted to explain the things I learned.

The `*` symbol indicates that I'm currently reading that book.

## You Don't Know JS by Kyle Simpson\*

Just Awesome. Have you been programming in JS and sometime you are just like: "I have no clue what is happening"? Well my friend, this book's for you.

Note that this is a somewhat advanced book. If you are not already familiar with JavaScript, don't start with this book.

## Rys git tutorial by Ryan Hodson

A really good book if you are looking to learn git and have no clue what the heck it is.

## EloquentJS

It was an OK book until I completely lost the connection with its content. Still a solid book if you want to learn about JavaScript.
